<p> Welcome to Tim Faverjon's website! </p>

<p> I'm a PhD student in Computational Sociology at the médialab at Sciences Po and Université Paris-Cité. </p>

<p> I work on recommendation algorithms, and in particular, I'm interested in algorithmic explicability techniques. </p>

<p> As a trained data scientist, I try to tackle the problems associated with recommendation algorithms with a dual approach, both technical and sociological. </p>
